# My Summer Internship Experience at ITC Limited – KITES Program

This summer, I had the opportunity to intern with **ITC Limited** under their prestigious **KITES Internship Program**, specifically with the **Fresh Fruits & Vegetables team** under the **Agri Business Division**.

Despite the nature of the domain, I worked on a very exciting **machine learning project** (which I unfortunately can’t disclose for obvious reasons 🙂). The experience gave me **valuable insights** into the functioning of one of India’s largest and most diversified conglomerates, and pushed me to:

- Think critically  
- Communicate effectively  
- Apply my **technical and project skills** in a real-world business setting

---

## 📝 Selection Process

The entire process had **four main stages**:

---

### 1. Aptitude Test (Online – Home Proctored)

- Conducted on a **third-party platform**
- Included:
  - Quantitative Aptitude  
  - Logical Reasoning  
  - Data Interpretation  
  - Verbal Ability  
- Time-bound; tested **accuracy and speed**
- Held **before** the official placement interviews at IIT Delhi

---

### 2. Group Discussion (GD)

- Shortlisted candidates appeared for a **case-based GD** in front of a **two-member panel**

- Held the **evening before** the interviews at IITD

> **Focus Areas**:

---

### 3. Technical Interview

- Conducted by the **same panel** as the GD, held **on the same night**
- Involved **open-ended, real-world problems**

**Examples**:
- I was asked: *“How would you monitor labor efficiency in a factory?”*  
- A friend was asked: *“Design a method to close a bottle cap.”*

> I provided multiple approaches, compared them on **cost and feasibility**, and **justified** every point.

⚠️ **Important Note**:  
Whatever you say — **they will dig deeper**. Avoid using **buzzwords** unless you truly understand them.

---

### 4. Final Interview (HR + Technical Blend)

- Supposed to be **HR**, but was actually a **hybrid round**
- Panel included **two senior leaders** from different verticals within ITC

**Discussion Topics**:
- HR Questions:
  - *“Are you open to relocating?”*
  - *“Why ITC?”*
- Deep dive into my **CV**:
  - My **Robotics Club** involvement  
  - **RoboCon volunteering**
  - Reasons for **dropping activities**, if any

> Focus was not just on technicals but also on:
